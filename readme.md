# JavaScript Calculator

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)

This project is a basic calculator using JavaScript. The calculator lets you take any two numbers and add, subtract, multiply and divide. The calculator does not use the `eval()` function and instead creates it's own methods for `add()`, `subtract()`, etc.

## Code Review

The HTML and CSS were designed in Webflow and the JavaScript was written by hand. The code could be improved by removing the irrelevant Webflow boilerplate code such as normalise.css, webflow.css and webflow.js.
